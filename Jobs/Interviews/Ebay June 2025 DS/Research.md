OK so this is my first interview after my college for a job, so probably tomm will be a highride.
But I don't want to break my streak, of clearing interview is first attempts.

Case 1- Anyway they will probabliy hiring in 2 case there is a certain project which requires a smart data scientist or logical person and probably be putting their questions in the same direction. In that case 
what project it might be? and if this the case the person who has created the SR role, will be the project manager of that projec and would have created the JD, in JD ofcourse a lot of AIML was mentioned
so taht is hwy I studied
NN I yet have to study CNN, RNN, LSTM(maybe), word embedding and Transformers
that is it i have a lot of projects that i worked on in the aspect so I can talk on them
Text to sql, Pdf to podcast, ChessGPT etc ettc
I have never used tensor flow or pytorch but i know about NN(DL) in backend 


==so with the limited time at hand I can cover, theory for CNN, RNN, LSTM word embedding and transformer but this is priority 3==

why would have he mentioned it in the JD 1st as this is the norm, everyone is moving to gen ai
2nd he might be doing nlp search based models for ecomm tools, I also wnat to work on that.

and also I want to work on this. so interview goes in this direction please push it.

2nd he put a lot of python and sql, so pyhon I can handle, even if he wants me to do modellingt i can manage, I just -practiced it in last 2 days, but SQl i will shit right then ans there.

why he want tha, so this is the main use case in the inustry right now
here I can talk about Field planning tool
Question can be like
Q. did you work on SQL - Answered
and ofcourse Ml and python he can always ask that is the most used thing in industry rn

and python is the most used programming language in the world so I ned to make sure to let them know that i am fluent in python

Also I can mention how buzzed I am about AI
Q. Tell me something about LLMs and GPTs. 

==So with the limited time i can do sql practice on kaggle priority 1==
also I in python and machince learning I've covered a lot of things but left
SVM, KNN, Naive bias, and boosting algorithms

==also Logistic regression is also pending, this I can conver in detail, priority 2==
 but other topics i can just skim,
==anyway, I'll need an over all revision for machine learning and python as well priority 1==

ML, DL, AI and SQL I think this will cover there expectation if they are tryingf to test my knowqledge on the subject
but 
Case 2 - they might be hiring is because they just need good datascientist in the system and hence are hiring then more than my knowlege and alignment to jkd they will focus on my previous experience which I mentioned in the resume.

so leavining first 2 point is my resume which afrre on modelling, lets just skim througfh all other points
 ==so i think other than the modelling 2 points everything else is I can discuss  properly on==
==but I think every one will be focusing a lot on the modelling as that is the. most important point for a datascientist Role so prioritty 1==



now a little bit research of ebay as a company
1. What they do or are doing rn
a lot of focus on AI, completed 30th year amy be a lot to learn from them in ecommmerce domain also they can be purchased by someone and that can lead me to get higher stocks value and bettrer company like amazon

checked their linked in nothing especial
1. what their employees has to say for them esp in indian context banglore office
4.6 on glass door good!
2. what do they pay usually for a data scientist role ans what are the benifits on top
3. and their inteviw in past
4. and reserch on people that have contacted me for this role
   first call and followback: Manish kumar  - i dont know if he is the guy but he is an analyst
