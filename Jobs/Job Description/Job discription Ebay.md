This is a high-agency, startup-style role—if you thrive in fast-moving, product-focused environments and love working closely with AI/ML, Product, and Engineering teams, this is for you.

 **What You’ll Do**

●  Analyze & Optimize eCommerce Product Data – Run deep SQL & Python analyses to find opportunities in taxonomy, ontology, and structured data for search & discovery improvements.

●  Leverage LLMs for Analytical Solutions – Use prompt engineering techniques to create AI-driven approaches for taxonomy validation, data enrichment, and classification.

●  Evaluate & Improve AI/ML Models – Develop systematic evaluation frameworks for product knowledge models, embeddings, and semantic search solutions.

●  Drive Insights & Strategy – Use data-driven storytelling to influence product and AI teams, helping shape decisions on catalog optimization, entity resolution, and knowledge graph development.

●  Integrate with AI/ML Teams – Work closely with data scientists and engineers to test and refine AI-based classification, search ranking, and recommendation models.

●  Prototype and Experiment – Move fast, test hypotheses, and build quick experiments to validate structured data strategies and AI-driven discovery improvements.

 **What We’re Looking For**

- 4 Years experience in analytics, data science role
- Strong Data & Analytics Skills – Proficiency in SQL & Python for data wrangling, analytics, and automation.
- Product Analytics Attitude – Familiarity with eCommerce search, recommendations, and knowledge graph applications
- Strong Communication – Ability to turn complex findings into actionable recommendations for Product, AI, and Engineering teams.
- AI/LLM Experience – Hands-on experience with LLMs, prompt engineering, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for AI-powered insights (Preferred)
- Model Evaluation Know-How – Ability to define metrics and evaluation frameworks for assessing ML-driven taxonomy and classification models..
- Startup DNA – High agency, thrive in fast-paced, iterative environments with deep cross-functional collaboration.

**Why Join Us?**

●  Build the AI-powered future of eCommerce product discovery.

●  Move fast & own impactful projects in a startup-like, high-agency culture.

●  Work directly with AI, Data Science, and Product teams to shape taxonomy & ontology strategies.

●  Get hands-on with AI/ML in a real-world, high-scale environment.
