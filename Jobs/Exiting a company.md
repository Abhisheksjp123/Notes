Lesson: company can do anything if they want to, so follow all the guidelines if you want to stay afloat. 

Things that you should  receive when you exit a company.
1. **Gratuity:** If you've completed 4 years and 8 months, you'll receive gratuity
2. **Relieving letter:** this is the most important thing. Neeti told me if i took a voluntarily exit than she will provide me a relieving letter else she will go with termination( which would be bad).
3. **Letter of Recommendation:** Ask your manger for this.   And ask her to put this on linkedin as well
4. Experience letter: 

what you should download: 
1. Pay slips for all the month, at least 6

3. ESOPS: for the vested stocks how can i exercise them
   they have closed the exercise window till August 15, so waiting for it to open
4. Increment letter

Hi Neeti,
Further to our recent discussion, I am submitting my voluntarily resignation from my position at Fractal, Effective 08/07/2025.

>As discussed I understand that:
>- I'll receive 1 month of compensation.
>- I will receive my entitled benefits including ESOPs and Gratuity as per company policy.

A major request, If we can treat this as a normal resignation, where I serve 1 month of notice period before relieving(as I am anyway getting paid 1 month of compensation with all the benefits). During this period, You can close my Fractal id and other accesses to ensure compliance. This would greatly help me justify my exit as a normal resignation to future employer.
>
I am committed to ensuring a smooth transition of my responsibilities during this period.
>
Please let me know the next steps for the exit process.
>
Thank you for the opportunity to work with Fractal.

Best regards,
Abhishek Shukla
