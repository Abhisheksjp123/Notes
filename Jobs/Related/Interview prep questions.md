Q. Explain your work at fractal
or Explain your current work.

Fractal mostly deals with CPG clients, popularly known as FMCG in India. And I have given sufficient time learning the nuances of that. Initially my focus was to get hand on tech side of the things, to all the data related technologies, like programming language, pyspark and azure; BI tools like Power bi, Excel and data analysis and DE tools as well. Plus of course data science was my primary focus. More recently I have pivoted to Client facing role and stakeholders management, I have my own clients/ projects, who i regularly connect with to gather requirements. This also requires deeper understanding with context with CPG.
