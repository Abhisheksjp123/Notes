## **🔑 What MSD Will Likely Look For**

1. **Pharma & Healthcare Data Understanding**
    
    - Clinical trial data (structured & unstructured)
        
    - Patient-level data (real-world evidence, EHR, claims)
        
    - Sales & marketing analytics (market access, segmentation, demand forecasting)
        
    - Pharmacovigilance (drug safety signal detection)
        
    
2. **Data Science Expertise**
    
    - Statistical modeling & ML (survival analysis, regression, classification, NLP for medical texts, etc.)
        
    - Feature engineering from heterogeneous sources (lab results, prescriptions, imaging, free text)
        
    - Deployment of ML models in regulated environments
        
    - Advanced topics: Causal inference, Bayesian models, generative AI applications in pharma
        
    
3. **Tech & Tools**
    
    - SQL, Python, R (core for analytics + ML)
        
    - ML frameworks: scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow/PyTorch
        
    - Cloud (Azure, AWS, GCP)—MSD has been moving workloads to **Azure**
        
    - Data platforms (Databricks, Snowflake, SAS, Azure Data Lake)
        
    
4. **Leadership & Management**
    
    - Stakeholder management (working with clinicians, regulatory, marketing, IT)
        
    - Translating business problems into DS projects
        
    - Mentoring junior data scientists, setting up best practices (MLOps, reproducibility, version control)
        
    - Balancing innovation vs compliance (pharma is tightly regulated)

5. **HR/Behavioral Screening**
    
    - Motivation for pharma/healthcare sector
        
    - Leadership style, managing cross-functional teams
        
    - Situational Qs (conflict resolution, prioritization)
        
## **🎯 Likely Interview Rounds**
5. **Technical/Data Science Round**
    
    - Case study: e.g., “How would you design a model to predict patient adherence to medication?”
        
    - ML/statistics Qs (bias/variance trade-off, feature selection, imbalanced data handling)
        
    - SQL + Python coding (data wrangling, analytics)
        
    
6. **Domain Case Study / Business Round**
    
    - They may test ability to bridge **science + business**:
        
        Example Q: “We want to understand why sales of a vaccine are declining in specific regions. How would you approach?”
        
    
7. **Leadership/Panel Interview**
    
    - Present a DS project you’ve led
        
    - Focus on _impact_, _team management_, _business value delivered_
## **📌 How You Can Prepare**

- **Review pharma case studies**: MSD heavily uses DS in drug discovery, clinical trial optimization, market access, and patient adherence.
    
- **Brush up on causal inference** (important in clinical/medical data).
    
- **Prepare STAR stories** (Situation-Task-Action-Result) around:
    
    - Leading a team
        
    - Convincing non-technical stakeholders
        
    - Handling data quality challenges

⚡ Pro tip: They might ask you to explain a **complex ML project in layman terms** (since you’ll interact with non-tech pharma leaders). Practice that!
