# Prescreening - In the telephonic round, He asked me questions MCQ

1. Analysing relationship b/w employee satisfaction  - satisfied/not satisfied and service type - call or online, you want to see if there is an association b/w them, which statistical test would you use. #scq
	a. Chi Square
	b. Annova
	c. T test

Ans  Chi Square, given t test

2. You have a model that is under fitting the data #scq
	a. High bias low variance
	b. Low bias high variance
	c. low bias low variance

Ans given High bias low variance

3. You are building a classifier to flag phishing emails, you are asked to prioritise catching all the phishing mails instead of false positive
	a. Recall
	b. Precision
	c. Accuracy

Ans given recall ans recall\
because recall/sensitivity does not concerns with false positive,
It focuses on Actual positives = TP/TP+FN

but recision tries to minimise false positive as well
Precision = TP/TP+FP

4. How  does l2 regularization that is ridge effect affects the coefficients of a linear model
	1. adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the coeff
	2. it shrinks the coeff towards 0 but not exactly to 0
	3. it sets all coeff to 0
	4. It does not affect the coeff
ans 2
5. Which of the following is the assumption of Lin reg #multiple
	1. observation are dependent on each other
	2. residuals should be normally distributed with the mean of 0
	3. residuals have constant variance at every level of the independent variable
	4. The independent variable are correlated with each other
ans given, 2,3

6. what is the benefit of python dict data structure
	1. It uses less memory than list
	2. the data are auto sorted
	3. it ensures key are all of same data type
	4. it enables fast lookup of values with keys
and given, 4

7. Which of the following data structures does not allows duplicates
Gave answer sets

8. Which of the follow DS is ordered and mutable
	1. List
	2. Set
	3. Tuple
Answer given 2, set and List, list are ordered by index

9. Which of the following is a characteristic of a greedy algo
	1. It makes the locally optimal choice at each step
	2. it  finds the globally optimal solution 
	3. It is the most efficient method for locally optimum solution
Ans given - 1

11.  Wha mechanism do transformers use to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence
	1. Convolution
	2. Pooling
	3. Attention
	4. recurrence
Ans given 3, attention


# Round 1: Coding interview
they will focus on traditional and Gen AI fundamentals and python
# Round 2: ML engineering side

# Round 3: Final 
you'll meet the leaders for a 30-40 minutes brief for fitment, maybe technical aspects


Round 2-3 can be clubbed and can be taken from office
