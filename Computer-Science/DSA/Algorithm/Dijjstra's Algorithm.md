Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm that finds the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph. It's one of the most important algorithms in computer science and is widely used in network routing, GPS navigation, and many other applications.

**How it works:** The algorithm maintains a set of unvisited nodes and keeps track of the shortest known distance from the starting node to every other node. It repeatedly selects the unvisited node with the smallest known distance, examines all its neighbors, and updates their distances if a shorter path is found.

**Step-by-step process:**

1. Set the distance to the starting node as 0 and all other nodes as infinity
2. Mark all nodes as unvisited and set the starting node as current
3. For the current node, examine all unvisited neighbors
4. Calculate tentative distances through the current node
5. If this distance is shorter than the previously recorded distance, update it
6. Mark the current node as visited
7. Select the unvisited node with the smallest distance as the new current node
8. Repeat until all nodes are visited or the destination is reached

**Key characteristics:**

- Uses a greedy approach (always chooses the locally optimal choice)
- Works only with non-negative edge weights
- Time complexity is O((V + E) log V) with a binary heap, where V is vertices and E is edges
- Guarantees finding the shortest path

**Common applications:**

- GPS navigation systems finding optimal routes
- Network routing protocols (like OSPF)
- Social networking (finding degrees of separation)
- Flight connection systems
- Game AI for pathfinding

The algorithm is named after Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra, who conceived it in 1956. It's particularly valuable because it not only finds the shortest path to a destination but also computes the shortest paths to all other reachable nodes from the starting point.
