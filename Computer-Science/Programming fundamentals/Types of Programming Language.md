Programming languages are typically classified in two main ways: by their **level of abstraction** (how close they are to the machine) and by their **programming paradigm** (the style in which they are written).

## Classification by Abstraction Level
This describes how much a language hides the complex details of the computer's hardware.
### High-Level Languages (Application Languages)
These languages are closer to human language, making them easier to read, write, and maintain. They manage complex details like memory allocation for you.

- **Purpose**: Primarily used for writing applications like websites, desktop software, and mobile apps.
- **Features**: Automatic memory management (garbage collection), rich built-in libraries, and a focus on programmer productivity.
- **Examples**: Python, Java, JavaScript, C#.
### Low-Level Languages (System Languages)
These languages are closer to the hardware, giving the programmer more direct control over system resources like memory and the CPU. This control comes at the cost of increased complexity.

- **Purpose**: Used for writing operating systems, device drivers, and performance-critical applications where efficiency is key.
- **Features**: Manual memory management, minimal built-in features, and direct hardware interaction.
- **Examples**: Assembly, C, Rust. (Note: C++ is a unique case as it has both high-level and low-level features).
## Classification by Programming Paradigm
A paradigm is a style or a "way of thinking" about how to structure and solve problems with code. Most modern languages support multiple paradigms.
### Procedural Programming
This paradigm structures code as a sequence of procedures or functions that perform tasks. The program flows from one step to the next, like following a recipe.
- **Core Idea**: A list of instructions for the computer to follow.
- **Example**: C.
### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
OOP organizes code around **objects**, which bundle together related data (attributes) and behavior (methods). This approach is like building with LEGO blocks, where each block (object) is a self-contained unit with its own properties.
- **Core Idea**: Creating objects that interact with one another.
- **Examples**: Java, C++, Python.
### Functional Programming (FP)
This paradigm treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It focuses on what to do, rather than how to do it.

- **Core Idea**: A flow of data through a series of pure functions.
- **Examples**: Haskell, Lisp. (Languages like Python and JavaScript also have powerful functional features).
