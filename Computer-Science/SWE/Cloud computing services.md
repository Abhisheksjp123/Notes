Cloud computing services are internet-based computing resources that provide on-demand access to servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics without requiring direct management of physical infrastructure.

[[Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)]] provides virtualized computing resources like servers, storage, and networking. You can rent virtual machines and configure them as needed. Examples include Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, and Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines.

[[Platform as a Service (PaaS)]] offers a development platform where you can build, deploy, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. Examples include Google App Engine, Heroku, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

[[Software as a Service (SaaS)]] delivers complete applications over the internet that you access through a web browser. Examples include Gmail, Salesforce, Microsoft 365, and Dropbox.

The key benefits include cost efficiency since you pay only for what you use, scalability to handle varying workloads, accessibility from anywhere with internet access, automatic updates and maintenance, and built-in disaster recovery options.

Major providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, IBM Cloud, and Oracle Cloud. These services have transformed how businesses operate by eliminating the need for large upfront investments in hardware and reducing IT maintenance overhead.


For Example:
Imagine you move to some place and you're renting something.
SAAS is like renting a fully furnished apartment, everything ready to go.
PAAS is like renting a apartment but you get to decorate it yourself.
IAAS is like renting an empty apartment - You bring all your furniture and stuff.
