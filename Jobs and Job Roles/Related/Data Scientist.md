Training a Machine learning model

Following are the tasks
1. [[Machine learning lifecycle]]
2. Preprocessing
3. EDA
4. Model Evaluation
5. Model understanding
6. Model Drift

Knowledge Required

Tools Required

**Projects:**
- ML
1. Predictive OLS models for retail
	1. Pricing and promotion models
	2. Marketing Media models
- DL
Chatbots

Ranks
1. Data Scientist or DS 1
2. Senior Data Scientist or DS 2
3. DS 3



Problems for model failure
1. Bad quality data or insufficient data
2. Not enough Compute/GPUs to train SOTA DL model
3. Not enough knowledge about ML


No lets say you've created a SOTA model, and you want to deploy it on a website for making it visible to end user.
You'll go to a [[Web Developer]] to integrate that model to website.

So requirement of first job role to work parallelly with [[Web Developer]] both backend and frontend.

Bottleneck: Web developer does not know any thing about ML and and DS does not know anything about Web D. So communication is difficult.

So the requirement came for a new Job Role called [[ML Engineer or MLOps Engineer]], who acts as an interpreter b/w DS and Web D.
He should know ML and Software and ideally also cloud computing
