Foundational model have turned out to be a revolution in ML field. They are trained by Big Techs on large amount of data and big computes. And are made available to the world for transfer learning.

These Foundational Models are SOTA and are multimodal and have wide range of capabilities along with tabular data.
And they can be fine tuned according to custom needs.

Example of a very popular Foundational model.
1. LLMs
These work best with the text data. Next word pred task


How it can play out?
[[Data Scientist]] and [[ML Engineer or MLOps Engineer]] who create and deploy these models respectively will be replaced by these Foundational model and the [[Web Developer]] can direcly hit the APIs of these foundational models to get his predicted output.

MAAS - model as a service

But there is a lot of AI Stack goes alongside working with Foundational model, there comes the role of [[AI Engineer]]

Tasks:
1. Fine tuning
2. Knows Basic knowhows of LLMs and Foundation models
3. Tooling like Lang chain/ Lang graph/ Bedrock
4. RAG
5. Prompt engineering - Zero shot, few shot, Chain of thought
6. LLM ops
7. Up to date with SOTA frameworks as growing field, study and update

SO basically a Software engineer working on the AI Stack
