“One of the projects I’m most proud of is a **demand forecasting tool** I built for a large manufacturer.

The client wanted a solution that could be shared with retailers, so they could not only view their actual sales but also submit their forecasts for different product categories. This was important because accurate retailer forecasting directly impacted the client’s **inventory planning and promotional strategy**.

I took ownership of this project from the ground up. I designed the database structure, built the Excel-based MVP template that retailers used, and set up pipelines that integrated sales and forecast data into SQL. I also collaborated with engineers to build APIs for data access, used VBA for automation, and later worked with Power BI developers to design dashboards that analyzed forecasting accuracy and retailer performance.

Throughout the project, I was the **sole client-facing point of contact** — managing requirements, handling bottlenecks, and presenting progress updates. This experience helped me develop strong **stakeholder management** skills in addition to the technical work.

The impact was significant: the client could better **manage inventory**, identify **forecasting gaps**, and even optimize their **retailer incentive programs**. In fact, the tool became so successful that it was extended for an additional year before being migrated to a dedicated demand planning platform.

Overall, this project is special to me because it combined **technical problem-solving, client leadership, and measurable business impact**.”


## Elevator pitch
“One of my most cherished projects was building a demand forecasting tool for a major manufacturer. I developed it from scratch — setting up the data pipelines, designing an Excel-based template for retailers, and collaborating with engineers and BI developers. I was also the sole client point of contact, managing requirements and updates. The tool helped the client improve **inventory planning**, track **forecast accuracy**, and design better **retailer incentives**. It was so impactful that it got extended for another year before moving to a larger platform.”
