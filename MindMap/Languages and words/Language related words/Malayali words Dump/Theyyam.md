The performances feature elaborate costumes, intricate face paintings, towering headdresses, and dramatic makeup that transform the performer into divine beings.

**Cultural Importance:** What makes Theyyam particularly significant is that it breaks traditional caste barriers - often performed by people from lower castes who, during the ritual, are revered as living gods by people of all social classes. This temporary reversal of social hierarchy makes it a unique cultural phenomenon.

The art form continues to thrive in rural Kerala, maintaining its authenticity while attracting cultural enthusiasts and tourists who witness these powerful spiritual performances in temple courtyards and sacred groves.
