Al Faham chicken is popular in Middle Eastern and Kerala cuisines because it is marinated in aromatic Arabian spices and yogurt, then charcoal-grilled for juicy, smoky flavor. Its popularity in Kerala grew due to strong Gulf connectionsâ€”many Malayalis working in the Middle East brought back a taste for this dish, leading to its widespread adoption and adaptation in Kerala restaurants.
