**Product mix**, also known as product assortment or product portfolio, refers to the complete range of products that a business offers for sale. It involves strategic decisions about:
- **Variety**: How many different product lines to carry (e.g., shampoos, soaps, snacks).
- **Assortment**: How many different versions of each product within a line to offer (e.g., different sizes, brands, or flavors of shampoo).
- **Depth**: How many units of each specific item to keep in stock.
## The Goal of Optimizing Product Mix
The goal of managing the product mix is to find the perfect balance that:
- Maximizes overall profit and revenue.
- Appeals to the widest possible range of target customers.
- Enhances brand image and customer loyalty.
