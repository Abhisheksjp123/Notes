Agentic AI = A really smart assistant (like ChatGPT) that can use tools
Imagine giving ChatGPT the ability to:

Use a calculator
Search the internet
Send emails
Control other apps

That's basically what agentic frameworks do - they take an already-smart AI and give it "hands" to interact with the world.
