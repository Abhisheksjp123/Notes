Deep learning refers specifically to a subset of machine learning methods that use **neural networks with multiple layers** (hence "deep") to model and learn from complex data patterns. While every deep learning model is based on neural networks, **not every use of neural networks is considered deep learning**.

- **Neural networks** are computational systems inspired by the brain, consisting of layers of interconnected "neurons."
    
- A **simple neural network with only one or two layers** (a perceptron or shallow network) is not considered deep learning.
    
- **Deep learning** specifically involves architectures with many layers—often called "deep neural networks"—which can capture highly complex, hierarchically structured information from data such as images, audio, or text.
