LangChain is a popular framework for building applications with large language models (LLMs). It provides tools and abstractions to help developers create more complex AI-powered applications.
1. Supports all major LLMs
2. Simplifies developing LLM based applications
3. Integration available for all major tools
4. Open source/free/actively developed
5. Supports all major Gen AI use cases
