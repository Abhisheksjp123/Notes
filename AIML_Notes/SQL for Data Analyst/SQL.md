SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. It's the primary language used to communicate with database management systems.

## What SQL Does

SQL allows you to:

- **Query data** - Retrieve specific information from databases
- **Insert, update, and delete** records
- **Create and modify** database structures (tables, indexes, etc.)
- **Control access** and set permissions
- **Manage transactions** and ensure data integrity

1. [[DDL - Data defination language]]
		[[DATA integrity]]
2. [[DML - Data manipulation language]] (Most Imp)
	[[Order of Query execution]]
	[[SQL Functions]]
3. DCL - Data control language
4. TCL - Transaction control language

*SQL is a general programming language, there are various DBMS that uses SQL, but since these are seperate environments, all have a slightly different syntaxes. In our study we'll use MySQL*
# Ideal formatting for SQL
1. SQL Keywords like CREATE, SELECT, LIKE should ideally be in capital letters
2. Column, database and table i.e all database object names should ideally be in small letters with __ inplace of space
