**CTEs (Common Table Expressions) are named temporary result sets that exist only for the duration of a single SQL statement and can be referenced within that statement.**

Key clarifications to your definition:

1. **Not exactly a "table"** - CTEs create a named result set or view-like construct, not a physical temporary table that's stored anywhere.
2. **Scope is limited** - They only exist for the duration of the specific SQL statement they're defined in, not beyond it.
3. **Can be referenced multiple times** - Within the same query, you can reference a CTE multiple times, which is one of their key advantages.

Here's the basic syntax:

sql

```sql
WITH cte_name AS (
    SELECT column1, column2 
    FROM table1 
    WHERE condition
)
SELECT * 
FROM cte_name 
WHERE another_condition;
```

So while your definition gets the general idea right - that CTEs help organize and structure queries by creating reusable components - it's more accurate to think of them as temporary named result sets rather than temporary tables.

subqueries are also same right just that they are part of the main query?

Edit

You're on the right track, but there are some important differences between CTEs and subqueries beyond just syntax:

## Similarities:

- Both create temporary result sets
- Both exist only for the duration of the query
- Both can be used to break down complex logic

## Key Differences:

**1. Reusability:**

- **Subqueries:** Can only be used once where they're defined
- **CTEs:** Can be referenced multiple times in the same query

sql

```sql
-- Subquery - if you need this logic twice, you'd have to write it twice
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE dept_id IN (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE budget > 100000)
AND salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees 
              WHERE dept_id IN (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE budget > 100000))

-- CTE - write once, use multiple times
WITH high_budget_depts AS (
    SELECT id FROM departments WHERE budget > 100000
)
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE dept_id IN (SELECT id FROM high_budget_depts)
AND salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees 
              WHERE dept_id IN (SELECT id FROM high_budget_depts))
```

**2. Readability:**

- **Subqueries:** Can create deeply nested, hard-to-read queries
- **CTEs:** Present logic in a top-down, more readable format

**3. Recursive capabilities:**

- **Subqueries:** Cannot be recursive
- **CTEs:** Support recursive queries (in most databases)

**4. Performance:**

- Generally similar performance, though this can vary by database system

So while they serve similar purposes, CTEs offer better organization and reusability for complex queries.
