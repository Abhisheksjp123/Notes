Q. What does it means to deploy a machine learning model?
A. Deployment is the process of integrating a trained ML model into a production environment where it can make predictions on real-world data and deliver business value.
characteristics for a productionized model:
- **Reliability**: High uptime and consistent performance
- **Monitoring**: Track model performance, data drift, and system health
- **Security**: Protect against malicious inputs and data breaches
- **Maintainability**: Easy to update, retrain, and version
- **Reproducibility**: Consistent results across environments
This is called Model deployment. 
**Broader Deployment Options**:

- **Web APIs**: Flask, FastAPI, Django REST
- **Cloud platforms**: AWS SageMaker, Google AI Platform, Azure ML
- **Edge deployment**: Mobile apps, IoT devices
- **Batch processing**: Scheduled predictions on large datasets
- **Streaming**: Real-time predictions on data streams
for ex: We can use a web based interface like flask, to get model results for our test dataset.
