- List are more user-friendly than Array and can contain different data types i.e list are heterogeneous while Array are homogenous
- Arrays are stored in a single memory location unlike list hence are faster and let memory intensive
- Numerical operation like, mathematical operations, linear algebra,  Fourier transformation are much easier in Numpy array than Lists
