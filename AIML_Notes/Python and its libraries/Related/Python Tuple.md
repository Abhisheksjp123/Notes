An **ordered** and **immutable** (unchangeable) collection of items. Once created, you can't add, remove, or change elements. They are very similar to list other then the immutability(just like strings) so all the operations will be same as list.

- **Creation**: `my_tuple = (1, "hello", 3.0)`
	- Or you can typecast a sequence with tuple()
- **Single-element tuple**: You must use a trailing comma: `single = (5,)`. Without the comma, `(5)` is just the integer `5`.
