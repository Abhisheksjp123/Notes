String are a sequence of characters. And Machines does not understands characters. It understands only numbers/binary. So it converts the characters into numbers. 
Most popular encoding of which is called [[ASCII]] - or 8 bit ASCII codes.
So first Character is converted to ASCII >> and then ASCII to binary.

But why UNICODE then?
ASCII was created for only english language, but as more languages were added and also to handle special characters UNICODE encoding is used or 16 bit UNICODE encoding.
