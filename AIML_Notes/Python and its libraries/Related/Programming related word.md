1. **Escape character**: he backslash `\` is called the **escape character**.
It's named that because it tells the computer to "escape" the normal way of interpreting the character that follows it and to treat it as a special instruction instead.
What It Does
Think of the `\` as a "heads-up" signal to the interpreter. It says, "Hey, don't treat the next character as normal text. It has a special meaning!"
### Common Examples
- `\n`: The `n` is no longer the letter 'n'. It becomes a **new line**.
    
- `\t`: The `t` is no longer the letter 't'. It becomes a **tab**.
    
- `\"`: The `"` is no longer a character that ends the string. It becomes a **literal quote character** that you can print.
