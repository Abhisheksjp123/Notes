Note
any data type can have functions or attributes. Functions are generally functions in the datatype class, which ideally have parameters that can be modified according to requirements.
For Example for pandas data frame df
df.head() is a function, by default it prints 5 values but it can take a value to customize number of values to print.

But an attribute on the other hand is fixed and does not need ()
ex: df.shape
