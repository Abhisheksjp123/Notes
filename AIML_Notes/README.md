# AIML_Notes
Comprehensive notes to revise AI ML Theories and projects


Topics under progress:
1. SHAP analysis for complex models and Preemptive Root Cause Analysis through it
2. python syntaxes
Topics to cover:
3. Edge vs cloud architecture
4. Stats model for understanding of the model statistics
5. Model lifecycle and analytics
6. Temporal variables and timeseries modelling
7. post modelling activities
	1. Deployment of preprocessing and final models through pickle/joblib
	2. model deviation and recommender system and Real-time Anomaly Detection to flag unexpected traget variable
	3. Uncertainty Quantification for confidence estimation.
	4. Robustness testing to validate performance under varying process conditions.


Not important but good to have:
1. Flask or fast api or steamlit for web deployment of models
