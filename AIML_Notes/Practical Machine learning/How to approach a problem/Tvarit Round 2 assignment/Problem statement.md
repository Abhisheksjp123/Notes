Role: Lead Data Scientist Assignment: Silicon (SI) Prediction in Hot Metal

**Problem Statement:**
Silicon (SI) content in hot metal is a critical indicator of blast furnace thermal stability.
Accurate SI prediction enables early detection of process deviations, allowing operators to
make proactive adjustments to maintain efficiency. This assignment focuses on developing
an advanced predictive model leveraging raw material chemistry, burden composition, and
operating parameters to ensure high accuracy, robustness, and real-world applicability.

"in summary, silicon content in the hot metal has significant effect on the blast furnace work. DS here need to quantify that by predicting SI based on the metal data so that scientists working on the same can utilize this information to adjust thigs accordingly"


Data available:
Data Availability
-  Dataset Size: 5,704 records, 25 features
- Target Variable: SI (Silicon content in hot metal)
"From this data we have to create a validation data set to check our model equation"
- Feature Categories:
o Operating Parameters: Blast temperature, top pressure, oxygen enrichment,
steam flow, blast momentum, permeability index, theoretical combustion
temperature.
o Timestamp Available: Allows for time-series analysis and trend identification.
"So it is a timeseries data"


Expected Deliverables
-  High-Performance Predictive Model for SI, optimized for accuracy and robustness.
"for accuracy and robustness thinking of using ensemble tree based models(Higher accuracy) instead of linear models(More interpretability)"
 -  Provision Real-time Anomaly Detection to flag unexpected SI deviations and
recommend corrective actions.
"this will probably require interpretability, to come up with a corrective action we need to see which variable is affecting the most and how, and then suggest the corrective measure"
 - Preemptive Root Cause Analysis to identify key parameters affecting SI and guide process control decisions.
   "Solution on same lines as last point"
 - Explainability & Actionability: SHAP analysis, feature importance, and business-relevant insights for furnace optimization.
 - Comprehensive Model Evaluation:
	o   Performance Metrics: R², RMSE, MAPE.
	o   Uncertainty Quantification for confidence estimation.
	o   Robustness Testing to validate performance under varying process conditions.
"both above 2 points we'll tackle later after we've created the model"
 - Optimization Algorithms: Implementation of Reinforcement Learning (RL), Genetic Algorithms (GA), or Bayesian Optimization to dynamically adjust furnace parameters for optimal SI levels.
   "I think this point is overpushing, given the time allotted to complete this project is 2 days, but suggest me if there is an easier way to do this"
 - Scalable Deployment Strategy*:
	o   Real-time inference with low-latency processing.
	o   Model Drift Detection & Retraining Mechanism for sustained performance.
	o   Cloud or Edge Deployment Considerations based on operational constraints.
	"What is your suggestion for deployment?, in approach we'll just write how we'll implement this production grade deployment but for current deployment what are your thoughts"

*Candidate should provide a high-level approach to deployment strategy, outlining key infrastructure and integration aspects.
