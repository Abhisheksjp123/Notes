## The Two Major Types of Statistics
Statistics is broadly divided into two main branches: Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Statistics.
## 1. Descriptive Statistics
This branch focuses on **summarizing, organizing, and describing** the main features of a dataset. It provides a straightforward summary of the data you have, without making any conclusions beyond that data.
Think of it as answering the question: _"What does my data look like?"_

Key measures in descriptive statistics include:
- **Measures of Central Tendency**: Mean, median, mode.
- **Measures of Dispersion (Spread)**: Standard deviation, variance, range.
- **Measures of Relationship**: Correlation, covariance.

## 2. Inferential Statistics
This branch uses data from a **sample** to make **inferences**, or draw conclusions, about a much larger **population**. It's used when it's impractical or impossible to collect data from everyone in a group.

To find the average salary of all new graduates in India, you can't survey millions of students. Instead, you survey a smaller, representative group (a sample) and use their average salary to _infer_ the average salary for the entire population.
### Key Terminology

1. **Population**: The entire group you want to study or draw conclusions about (e.g., all new graduates in India).
2. **Sample**: A smaller, manageable subset of the population. For the inference to be valid, the sample must be:
	- **Unbiased**: Every individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected.
	- **Representative**: The characteristics of the sample reflect the characteristics of the population.
3. **Statistic**: A numerical measure that describes a characteristic of a **sample** (e.g., the average salary of the students you surveyed).
4. **Parameter**: A numerical measure that describes a characteristic of the entire **population** (e.g., the true average salary of _all_ new graduates in India, which is what you're trying to estimate).

> **Note**: The formulas and notations for statistics and parameters are often different. For example, the sample mean is denoted as `xˉ`, while the population mean is denoted as μ.

This is a powerful field of science that includes crucial topics like **Hypothesis Testing, Confidence Intervals, and the Central Limit Theorem**.
