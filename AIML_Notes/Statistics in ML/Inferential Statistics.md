This branch uses data from a **sample** to make **inferences**, or draw conclusions, about a much larger **population**. It's used when it's impractical or impossible to collect data from everyone in a group.

To find the average salary of all new graduates in India, you can't survey millions of students. Instead, you survey a smaller, representative group (a sample) and use their average salary to _infer_ the average salary for the entire population.
### Key Terminology

1. **Population**: The entire group you want to study or draw conclusions about (e.g., all new graduates in India).
2. **Sample**: A smaller, manageable subset of the population. For the inference to be valid, the sample must be:
	- **Unbiased**: Every individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected.
	- **Representative**: The characteristics of the sample reflect the characteristics of the population.
3. **Statistic**: A numerical measure that describes a characteristic of a **sample** (e.g., the average salary of the students you surveyed).
4. **Parameter**: A numerical measure that describes a characteristic of the entire **population** (e.g., the true average salary of _all_ new graduates in India, which is what you're trying to estimate).

> **Note**: The formulas and notations for statistics and parameters are often different. For example, the sample mean is denoted as `xˉ`, while the population mean is denoted as μ.

## Confidence in your predicted value.
When we use a sample to estimate a value for an entire population, we know our estimate won't be perfect. Statisticians use two key tools—**Confidence Intervals** and **Hypothesis Testing (with p-values)**—to quantify the uncertainty and express the confidence we have in our findings.
