>The null hypothesis is that the coin is fair, and the alternative hypothesis is that the coin is biased - biased toward tails

Sample size = 10 (Central Limit Theorem cannot be applied due to a small sample size) The p-value here is the probability of observing the results obtained given that the null hypothesis is true, i.e., under the assumption that the coin is fair. Total outcomes for 10 flips : 210=1024210=1024
>Probability of the given result is the p-value is  101024=0.0098102410​=0.0098  
The null hypothesis can be rejected at a 0.05 significance level.
