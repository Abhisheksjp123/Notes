AB testing (also called A/B testing or split testing) is a method of comparing two versions of something to determine which performs better. It's essentially a controlled experiment where you show version A to one group of users and version B to another group, then measure which version achieves your desired outcome more effectively.

**How it works:** You randomly divide your audience into two groups. Group A sees the original version (called the "control"), while Group B sees a modified version (the "variant" or "treatment"). You then track metrics like conversion rates, click-through rates, engagement, or sales to see which version performs better.

**Common applications:**

- Website design (testing different layouts, colors, or button placements)
- Email marketing (subject lines, content, send times)
- Mobile apps (features, user interfaces)
- Advertising (headlines, images, calls-to-action)
- Product features (pricing, checkout processes)

**Key principles:** The test should change only one variable at a time to isolate what's causing any performance difference. You need a large enough sample size to ensure statistical significance, and the test should run long enough to account for variations in user behavior over time.

**Benefits:** AB testing removes guesswork from decision-making by providing data-driven insights. Instead of assuming what users prefer, you can measure their actual behavior and make improvements based on evidence rather than opinions.

The goal is to optimize user experience and business outcomes by continuously testing and refining different elements based on real user data.
