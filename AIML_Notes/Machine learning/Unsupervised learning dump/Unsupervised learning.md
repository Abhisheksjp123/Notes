Unsupervised learning is like being a detective with a pile of clues but no case file. You have data, but no "right answers" to learn from. Your job is to find hidden patterns, structures, or relationships in the data.

Main Types of Unsupervised Learning:

### 1. [[Clustering]]

**What it does**: Groups similar data points together

### 2. [[Dimensionality Reduction]]

**What it does**: Simplifies data while keeping important information
**Common algorithms**:
- [[PCA (Principal Component Analysis)]]: Finds the most important directions in data
- **t-SNE**: Great for visualisation, preserves local neighbourhoods
### 3. [[Association Rule Learning]]

**What it does**: Finds relationships between different items

**Classic example**: "People who buy bread and milk also tend to buy eggs" (market basket analysis)

**Applications**:

- Product recommendations
- Web usage patterns
- Gene expression analysis
