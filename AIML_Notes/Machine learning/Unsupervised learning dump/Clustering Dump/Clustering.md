**Real-world example**: A streaming service wants to understand their users better. They cluster users based on viewing habits and discover groups like "Weekend Binge Watchers," "Documentary Enthusiasts," and "Comedy Lovers."

**Common algorithms**:
- [[K-Means]]: Divides data into k clusters (you specify k)
- [[Hierarchical]]: Creates a tree of clusters
- [[DBSCAN]]: Finds clusters of varying shapes and sizes
