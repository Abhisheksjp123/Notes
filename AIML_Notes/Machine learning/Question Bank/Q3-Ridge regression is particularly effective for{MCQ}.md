Q3-Ridge regression is particularly effective for a) Feature selection b) Handling multicollinearity c) Creating sparse models d) Increasing model complexity.

- **Correct answer:** b (Handling multicollinearity)
- **Explanation:** Ridge regression does NOT create sparse models - it shrinks coefficients but never sets them to exactly zero. Ridge's key strength is handling multicollinearity by distributing weights among correlated features.
