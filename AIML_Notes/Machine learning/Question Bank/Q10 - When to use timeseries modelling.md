**When you likely need time series modeling:**

aving a timestamp or time series column in your data doesn't automatically mean you _must_ use time series modeling. It depends on the nature of your problem and how the time dimension relates to what you're trying to predict or analyze.

- **When the order of data points matters:** If the value of a data point is dependent on previous data points (e.g., stock prices, temperature readings, sales figures over time), then time series models are crucial for capturing that temporal dependency.
- - **When you want to forecast future values:** Time series models are specifically designed for forecasting based on historical patterns, trends, and seasonality.
- - **When you need to analyze trends, seasonality, or cycles:** Time series analysis helps identify and understand these temporal components in your data.
