Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

Unlike other forms of machine learning, RL doesn't learn from a fixed dataset. Instead, it learns through trial and error, much like how humans and animals learn from experience.

**Key components of reinforcement learning:**

**Agent** - The learner or decision-maker (like a game-playing AI or robot)

**Environment** - The world the agent operates in (like a chess board, video game, or physical space)

**Actions** - What the agent can do (move pieces, press buttons, turn wheels)

**State** - The current situation or observation of the environment

**Reward** - Positive or negative feedback the agent receives after taking an action

**Policy** - The strategy the agent uses to decide which action to take in each state

**The learning process works like this:**
1. Agent observes the current state
2. Agent chooses an action based on its current policy
3. Environment responds with a new state and a reward
4. Agent updates its policy to maximize future rewards
5. Process repeats

**Real-world examples:**
- Game-playing AIs (like AlphaGo learning to play Go)
- Autonomous vehicles learning to drive safely
- Recommendation systems learning user preferences
- Robot arms learning to manipulate objects
- Trading algorithms learning market strategies

The key insight is that the agent doesn't need to be told the "correct" answer for each situation. Instead, it discovers effective strategies by exploring different actions and learning which ones lead to better outcomes over time.
