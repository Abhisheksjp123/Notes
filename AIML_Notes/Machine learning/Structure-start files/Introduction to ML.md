Machine learning is a collection of tools and technique that helps turn data to hopefully good decisions. For example, it helps classify whether a person has disease or not based on previous hospital data, this is called Classification. And predict what will be the quarterly sales next quarter based on previous data, this is called Quantitative prediction.

Machine learning is a subset of [[Artificial intelligence (AI)]]

## How It's Different from Traditional Programming

**Traditional Programming**: Input + Program → Output

- We write specific rules and logic
- Example: "If temperature > 30°C, recommend shorts"

**Machine Learning**: Input + Output → Program

- We provide examples of inputs and their correct outputs
- The algorithm discovers the rules automatically
- Example: Show 1000 weather/clothing pairs, let it learn the pattern

Types of Machine Learning:
1. [[Supervised learning]]
2. [[Unsupervised learning]]
3. [[Reinforcement learning]]
