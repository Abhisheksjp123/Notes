IQR stands for inter quantile range. It's a measure of statistical dispersion that shows the range between the first Quantile (Q1) and the Third Quantile (Q3) in a dataset.
IQR = Q3-Q1
Example: consider this data of heights in feet's, where heights at extreme ends make no sense.
what IQR is doing is identifying a nominal upper and lower limit for height.
