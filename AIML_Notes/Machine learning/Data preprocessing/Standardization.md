**StandardScaler (Standardization):**
More popular than [[Normalization ML]], this brings the mean to 0 and standard deviation to 1
**Note Standardization is a liner transformation, which means it does not affect the distribution of the variable(Does not make it normal distribution), Just shrinks it.

- Formula: 
$$
Standardization = (x - mean) / std\ deviation
$$

- Result: Mean = 0, Standard deviation = 1
- Range: Can be any values (typically -3 to +3)
- Also called: Z-score normalization
