**What it does**: Simplifies data while keeping important information

**Why it's useful**:

- Visualization (plot 100-dimensional data in 2D)
- Remove noise and redundancy
- Speed up other algorithms

**Real-world example**: A company has customer data with 50 features (age, income, purchase history, etc.). Dimensionality reduction might reveal that most variation comes from just 3 underlying factors: "spending power," "tech-savviness," and "brand loyalty."

**Common algorithms**:

- [[PCA (Principal Component Analysis)]]: Finds the most important directions in data
- **t-SNE**: Great for visualization, preserves local neighborhoods
