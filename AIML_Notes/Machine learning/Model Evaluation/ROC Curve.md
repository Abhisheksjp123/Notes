We can plot several possible confusion matrix with different threshold of a model(in this example we're taking logistic regression but we can create confusion matrix for other classification model as well) through ROC Curve.

**ROC (** Receiver operator characteristics curve) provides a way to Summaries all possible confusion matrix that each threshold produced for us.  
  
It is a plot b/w  
y- axis → true positive rates ( sensitivity )  
x - axis → false positive rates ( 1- specificity )

So for the above example ROC curve can be created as
