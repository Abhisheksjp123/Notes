ans. The bias variance tradeoff isa key Concept in ML and statistics that highlights the tradeoff b/w two Sources of error that affect the performance of predictive model.  
1. Bias:  
→ Bias refers to error introduced by approximating a real world problem , which may be complex with a simplified model.  
→ A model with high bias gives too little attention to training date and oversimplifies the model leading to underfitting.  
→ Ex using a linear model to fit a non linear data  
  
2. Variance  
→ Variance refers to error introduced by model sensitivity to small fluctuation in the training data  
→ A model with high variance pays too much attention to training data Capturing noise along with the signal, leading to overfitting  
→ example a decision tree that goes too deep perfectly fitting on training data but performing poorly on unseen data.  
  
3. Trade off a good model needs to balance bias and variants to achieve low generalization error i.e Error on unseen data  
I.e low bias and low variance
