#### **Why Linear Regression Remains Crucial Despite Its Simplicity:**

**1. Interpretability Over Accuracy** While linear regression may have lower accuracy on complex, multi-dimensional data, it excels at showing **how each independent variable affects the dependent variable**. The coefficients directly represent the relationship/elasticity between variables. Many business problems need **explanation over prediction** - "Why did sales increase?" matters more than perfect accuracy.

**2. Foundation for Understanding** Linear regression teaches fundamental ML concepts:
- Loss functions (MSE)
- [[Gradient descent]] optimisation
- Overfitting/underfitting
- [[Feature Scaling]] importance
- [[Regularization]] (Ridge/Lasso build on linear regression)

**3. [[Bayesian Statistics]] Integration**: Linear regression provides **explicit control over coefficients/priors**, making it ideal for Bayesian approaches where you want to incorporate prior knowledge or uncertainty quantification.

**4. Practical Advantages**

- **Fast training/prediction**
- **Requires minimal data**
- **Baseline model** - establishes performance floor
- **Feature importance** easily identified
- **No hyperparameter tuning complexity**
