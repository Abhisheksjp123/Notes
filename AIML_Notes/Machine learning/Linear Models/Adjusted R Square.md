Note as the equation in case of multiple linear regression will  be like:
Y= 0.1 +0.7x+ 0.3z  
And with the introduction of every new variable ( lets say we take flipping a Coin which has no direct relation with mouse size) will not harm the equation as if the Variable is making the fit worse it coefficient will go 0 .
Now, but due to random chance there might a probability that the small Mice in the data Set gets more head, this will introduce a coefficient and Improve RSq which is a false impression of a better model.
Because of this people use  [[Adjusted R Square]] which is [[R Square]] scaled with number of parameters
